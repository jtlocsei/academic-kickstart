Together with my wife I run the ecommerce and web-publishing business [homemade-gifts-made-easy.com](https:/www.homemade-gifts-made-easy.com). Before that, I studied mechical engineering and physics, did a research year in theoretical astrophysics, did a PhD in applied mathematics, worked for a few years in technology consulting and new product development, and started a homemade-gifts-made-easy.com as an experimental online side business. The side business took off and turned out to be a lot of fun, so back in 2013 my wife and I left our jobs to work on it full time and haven't looked back. These days I spend my time growing our business, playing with my kids, and expanding my coding skills.
