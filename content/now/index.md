## Online Business

My wife and I are growing our online business [homemade-gifts-made-easy.com](https://www.homemade-gifts-made-easy.com) by creating more content in the area of printables & templates. We've streamlined much of the workflow, but we remain bottlenecks in the process. Perhaps we could hire freelance writers or designers to speed things up. 

We've recently started a [Perth Online Business Owners](https://www.meetup.com/Perth-Online-Business-Owners/) meetup group and are looking forward to organising our first meetup soon.


## Programming

I'm in the process of re-writing our poster generators so that the poster renders and updates in the browser instantly as the user types their text. I think that will be a far superior user experience compared to our current [poster generators](https://www.homemade-gifts-made-easy.com/personalized-poster-40th-birthday-gift.html) where the user needs to click "preview" to see their changes. Instant feedback could be a powerful tool to help users unlock their own creativity, as per Brett Victor's famous talk [Inventing on Principle](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/04/bret-victors-inventing-on-principle-and-a-few-things-it-inspired/).
