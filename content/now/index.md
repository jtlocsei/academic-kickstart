## Online Business

My wife and I are growing printables and templates side of our online business [homemade-gifts-made-easy.com](https://www.homemade-gifts-made-easy.com). We've streamlined much of the workflow, but we remain bottlenecks in the process. Perhaps we could hire freelance writers or designers to speed things up. 

We've recently started a [Perth Online Business Owners](https://www.meetup.com/Perth-Online-Business-Owners/) meetup group and it's been loads of fun meeting other online business owners.


## Programming

I'm writing a poster-generator app in [Re-frame](https://day8.github.io/re-frame/). Re-frame has clicked for me and I feel productive with it.

Also, I'm teaching myself the [Fulcro](https://fulcro.fulcrologic.com/) app framework. I'm finding it hard going. It hasn't clicked for me yet but I hope it will soon.
