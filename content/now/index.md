## Online Business

My wife and I are growing our online business [homemade-gifts-made-easy.com](https://www.homemade-gifts-made-easy.com) by creating more content in the area of printables & templates. We've streamlined much of the workflow, but we remain bottlenecks in the process. Perhaps we could hire freelance writers or designers to speed things up. 

We've recently started a [Perth Online Business Owners](https://www.meetup.com/Perth-Online-Business-Owners/) meetup group and are looking forward to organising our first meetup soon.


## Programming

I've been writing tools to automate parts of our content creation process, e.g. for image processing and html templating.
