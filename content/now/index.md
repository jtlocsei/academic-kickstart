## Online Business

My wife and I are growing printables and templates side of our online business [homemade-gifts-made-easy.com](https://www.homemade-gifts-made-easy.com). We've streamlined much of the workflow, but we remain bottlenecks in the process. Perhaps we could hire freelance writers or designers to speed things up. 

We've recently started a [Perth Online Business Owners](https://www.meetup.com/Perth-Online-Business-Owners/) meetup group and it's been loads of fun meeting other online business owners.


## Programming

I've been writing tools to automate parts of our content creation process, e.g. for image processing and html templating.
